```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this assignment I will simulate some data about temperature and pressure.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)

time <- 1:500
temp <- rnorm(500, mean = 25, sd = 2)
pres <- rnorm(500, mean = 1, sd = .01)

plot_ly(x = ~time, y = ~temp, z = ~pres, type = 'scatter3d', color = ~temp)
```
